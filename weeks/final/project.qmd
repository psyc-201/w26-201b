## Overview

The final project is your opportunity to apply the statistical modeling skills you've learned throughout the course to a research question of your choice.

## Timeline

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| Week 8 (Feb 27) | Project proposal due |
| Week 10 (Mar 13) | Draft analysis due (optional feedback) |
| Final Exam Week (Mar 21) | Final project due |

## Requirements

### 1. Research Question

Formulate a clear, answerable research question that requires statistical analysis.

### 2. Data

- Use a publicly available dataset OR
- Use data from your own research (with appropriate permissions)
- Minimum 100 observations recommended

### 3. Analysis

Your analysis should include:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Summary statistics
   - Visualizations
   - Data quality assessment

2. **Statistical Modeling**
   - At least one model from the course (GLM, LMM, etc.)
   - Model diagnostics
   - Model comparison (if appropriate)

3. **Inference or Prediction**
   - Parameter estimates with uncertainty
   - Hypothesis tests or confidence intervals
   - OR cross-validated prediction performance

4. **Interpretation**
   - What do the results mean?
   - Limitations
   - Future directions

### 4. Deliverables

1. **Rendered .qmd file** (HTML or PDF)
   - Introduction and research question
   - Methods
   - Results (with code)
   - Discussion

2. **Data and code**
   - All code should be reproducible
   - Include data or instructions for obtaining it

## Grading Rubric

| Component | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| Research question clarity | 10 |
| Data preparation and EDA | 15 |
| Appropriate model choice | 20 |
| Model fitting and diagnostics | 20 |
| Interpretation and conclusions | 20 |
| Code quality and reproducibility | 10 |
| Writing and presentation | 5 |
| **Total** | **100** |

## Proposal Template

Submit a 1-page proposal including:

1. **Research question** (1-2 sentences)
2. **Data source** (what data, where from, sample size)
3. **Proposed analysis** (what models/methods)
4. **Expected challenges** (what might be tricky?)

## Example Projects

Past successful projects have included:

- Predicting movie ratings with mixed models (repeated measures per user)
- Analyzing experimental psychology data with factorial ANOVA/LMM
- Logistic regression for predicting customer churn
- Power analysis for a planned study
- Factor analysis of survey responses

## Resources

- Office hours: TBD
- Course materials: All previous weeks
- Statistical consulting: TBD

## Submission

Submit via GitHub Classroom by **Saturday, March 21, 2026**.

Good luck!
