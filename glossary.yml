homebrew: |
  A command-line package manager for macOS that lets you install packages and applications using the `brew` command

command-line-program: |
  A program that you interact with exclusively from your terminal; often abbreviated as CLI

ide: |
  Integrated-development-environment; a program that includes a code-editor, terminal/console, and other helpful features to be a "one-stop-shop" for most of your needs

terminal: |
  An application for controlling your computer via commands that you type in (e.g. `cd`, `ls`) instead of point-and-click

shell: |
  A program that runs automatically when your Terminal starts and interprets the commands you type to control your computer instead of pointing-and-clicking. FYI: the default shell on macOS is zsh not bash.

quarto: |
  a scientific publishing tool that allows you to mix *prose* and *code-cells* to render executable documents in a variety of formats (website, PDF, etc)

uv: |
  A library and environment manager for Python making it easy to create/add/update additional Python libraries & tools in a reproducible and isolated way. using a pyproject.toml "blueprints" file

environment: |
  Really just a hidden folder on your computer (typically .venv/) that contains an isolated Python installation with all additional libraries and tools. uv handles this all for us!

git: |
  A CLI to version control LOCAL files and folders called repositories. See the git guide for more details and a command cheatsheet.

github: |
  A online cloud-based service for synchronize local git repositories with REMOTE repositories on github.com. This faciliates collaborative works flows and open-source development. We're using the Github Classroom feature built-up on this for our course.

github-userid: |
  Your user "handle" on github.com that identifies you when using git commands (local) and interacting with Github.com (remote). E.g. Eshin's is @ejolly

rstudio: |
  An IDE originally designed to work with R, but also works well with Quarto documents. Also includes a Terminal separate from the R console for running shell commands.

vscode: |
  An extremely popular general purpose IDE that supports multiple language (e.g. Python, R, Javascript) and makes use of extensions to add additional functionality (e.g. quarto rendering, Python notebooks).

python-notebook: |
  .py files that we can work with interactively using code-cells and markdown-cells (similar to quarto chunks). A much richer interface for interactively working with pieces of code one-at-a-time  

quarto-doc: |
  .qmd files that contain a mix of prose (markdown) and code-chunks (Python/R) that you can preview and render with Quarto. By default quarto will always rerun ALL code-chunks in the file upon saving.

marimo: |
  A program like Quarto that can render .py files as interactive Python notebooks with code cells. FYI: marimo is the modern alternative to Jupyter notebooks which you may have heard of/used in the past.

estimator: |
  A rule for aggregating data (e.g. mean) under a set of assumptions defined by a loss-function (e.g. SSE)

loss-function: |
  Quantifies the disparity between an estimator and observations (e.g squared vs absolue errors).

central-limit-theorem: |
  The sampling distribution of an estimator converges to a normal (gaussian) distribution even if the underlying samples are not normally distributed.

law-of-large-numbers: |
  An estimator stabilizes to a true theoretical value (population statistic) as we aggregate more independent observations.

no-free-lunch-theorem: |
  Any estimator that performs well somewhere, must perform poorly elsewhere.

bootstrap-resampling: |
  A program like Quarto that can render .py files as interactive Python notebooks with code cells. FYI: marimo is the modern alternative to Jupyter notebooks which you may have heard of/used in the past.

permutation-resampling: |
  A program like Quarto that can render .py files as interactive Python notebooks with code cells. FYI: marimo is the modern alternative to Jupyter notebooks which you may have heard of/used in the past.

simulation-resampling: |
  A program like Quarto that can render .py files as interactive Python notebooks with code cells. FYI: marimo is the modern alternative to Jupyter notebooks which you may have heard of/used in the past.

cross-validation-resampling: |
  A program like Quarto that can render .py files as interactive Python notebooks with code cells. FYI: marimo is the modern alternative to Jupyter notebooks which you may have heard of/used in the past.
